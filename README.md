# realme smartphone website (Demo)
This is a realme website project I created to demonstrate my HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript/jQuery, Git/ Github and gereal web development skills.
As a junior software Developer my main responsibilites would be:

1. Working with a UX/UI design team, Senior developer & SEO team alongside a existing web development team. Each responsible for managing, developing, maintaining and supporting 
various web projects.

As a junior member, client briefs & project details will larging be all pre-determined. Meaning I won't be responsible for designing an entire website functionality.

Although I will be required to have an minimum understanding of design principles, example the difference between **padding** and **margin**.

My main responsibilities will be converting client briefs & project details into concept designs with the goal of reaching production and finally live service. 

# Project Context
As like most people I have a smartphone. realme is a Chinese smartphone manufacturer and a subsidiary of BBK Electronics. And for this project I proceed as if the smartphone manufacturer were seeking to build a UK version of their smartphone website.

I was included into the development team and which was given a client brief, project details and a Adobe XD design file. These hypothetical details in this demo project is the actual realme UK website located here: https://www.realme.com/uk/

# My Objective
My objective was to build a realme website which is exactly the same as the current realme UK website. My development process was to develop the website as if I was on a development team following a design brief.

Although, I have an understanding of software development life cycle, example agile , scrum or waterfall. For this demo project it would be deficult for me to display my knowledge of these development methodologies.

Therefore, if you look though my **git commit submit history** I tried to make clear documentation of each changes made throughout the development process.

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot building this application more importantly git commit documentation. I was connecting from a branch into a main development repo and getting used to clearly documenting after every change I made was a learning process.

Alternatively, theres a lot of other lessons a learned, but to mention a few:

1. Javascript functions, HTML DOM and Browser BOM. (Specifically the product pages & product images & changing the product image color for the correct product colour)
2. Creating a remote repository to learn a better development workflow process.
3. Using gitpage to deploy the website.
4. Responsive website using Bootstrap 5 class intergration for mobile & tablet view-width breakpoints.
5. SCSS File Structure, _font.scss, color.scss etc. Creating seperate SCSS files for different attributes for better CSS opimazation.
6. Using Git operations to create a local repo. Also general git operations link, init, add, status, commit, remote, push and pull.
