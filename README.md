# realme smartphone website (Demo)
This is a realme website project I created to demonstrate my HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript/jQuery, Git/ Github and gereal web development skills.
As a junior software Developer my main responsibilites would be:

1. Working with a UX/UI design team, Senior developer & SEO team alongside a existing web development team. Each responsible for managing, developing, maintaining and supporting 
various web projects.

As a junior member, client briefs & project details will larging be all pre-determined. Meaning I won't be responsible for designing an entire website functionality.

Although I will be required to have an minimum understanding of design principles, example the difference between **padding** and **margin**.

My main responsibilities will be converting client briefs & project details into concept designs with the goal of reaching production and finally live service. 

# Project Context
As like most people I have a smartphone. realme is a Chinese smartphone manufacturer and a subsidiary of BBK Electronics. And for this project I proceed as if the smartphone manufacturer were seeking to build a UK version of their smartphone website.

I was included into the development team and which was given a client brief, project details and a Adobe XD design file. These hypothetical details in this demo project is the actual realme UK website located here: https://www.realme.com/uk/
